  SEM HC Dorsal lancet: This image shows a scanning electron micrograph of the
  anterior end of a Haemonchus contortus worm. Clearly visible is the worm's
  feeding apparatus, the dorsal lancet, that enables this blood sucking worm to
  feed on blood after piercing the abomasal (stomach) mucosa. This nematode has
  the highest levels of drug resistance of any parasitic worm, and in some
  areas it is resistant to every known anthelmintic (dewormer) drug.

  Haemonchus on surface: This image shows the inside of the abomasum (stomach)
  of a goat with a heavy infection of Haemonchus contortus. Red color of worms
  is a result of their feeding on blood.
