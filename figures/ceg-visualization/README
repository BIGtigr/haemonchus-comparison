These visualizations are a result of running Kablammo 2014.02.22 against
PRJEB506_complete_intersection_PRJNA205202_partial.blast.xml (included in this
directory for reference).

The two hits correspond to to the query KOG0948.4.
  misassembled_1.svg corresponds to "scaffold17512 1 113348"
  misassembled_2.svg corresponds to "C443019 1 3852"

Note that this was generated by BLASTing the nucleotide sequence CEGMA found
for the CEG in question within PRJEB506, against the PRJNA205202 genome. As
this sequence was output by CEGMA, perhaps it would be better to run blastp
using the original protein sequence CEGMA relies on, rather than the nucleotide
sequence it found within the genome.
